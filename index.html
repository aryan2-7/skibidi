								<p>Oh taha some refer to him as the lord of rizz. In the picture shown abhove he has assumed his mating position and all the ladies are drolling. You might be wondering how you can too have such phenomenal, ovulation indusing rizz, but it's something only the skilled and masters at the female gaze can do</p>

								<h2 class="major">How the sigma acts</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Here you can see the rizzler in his stance, he has no fear for the one taking the pictures as he knows a real sigma never shows their emotions, even the gaze he has towards the camera induces true fear of competency to the fellow beta viewers (1 shiver = +999 aura). His mere presence boosts the aura of a room by magnitues even if that is at the expence of average room IQ. </p>

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">Facial Hair Tips</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Here you can see the sigma rizzler proudly show off his masuline and strong facial features like that beard, moustache and unibrow. He knows there is no competition to this level of grooming and the ladies are all intiminaded yet hopelessly attracted to such a man, he belives that is why no females flirt with him because they too know just how sigma he is, when they approach him they hear sounds like "mango mango mango mango"</p>

							<h2 class="major">Sigma yet SUSSY?</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Finally you can see the sigma in action, in school he makes sure to always manspread to assert dominance and show the ladies what they're missing out on. It has been informed that the sigma rizzler bearded taha acts gay with the boys and when askes about this he replies by saying the girls lack the testosterone he needs be around to upkeep his aura(tho there are a few that have higher T levels than him), to counter this he always listens to talk thua, eats lunchables and listens to the thick of it, drinks still water, and uses the balken method, but sometimes thats not enough and has to go after the guys who he believes are his competition. This is concsive proof that he is not just sigma but also Skibidi, hence proved + c. Now watch the video to fully understand Taha's story</p>
